◊center{◊h1{Research Tips}}

Over the years I have discovered several methods for improving one's research ability. I shall
record them here for your benefit. If any of these are helpful for you, please consider adding me to
the acknowledgments of your undoubtedly numerous papers.

◊bf{1. Wear a hat.}

90% of ideas escape from your head by radiation. Wear a hat to keep them in.
The best material for trapping ideas is denim. On the other hand, metals have the undesirable effect
of dissipating ideas even faster, due to their high mnemoconductance, so avoid hats containing
metal.

◊bf{2. Grow a beard or a braid.}

Research is done by moving ideas from your head, to your hands, to the paper or keyboard. Usually
this process is slow because the ideas must travel down your neck, through the torso, to the hands.
The human body, sadly, has low mnemoconductance, and therefore this is a slow and inefficient
process, transforming many ideas into waste heat. Human hair has higher mnemoconductance than the
body, and therefore ideas can be moved more efficiently from the head to the hand by stroking one's
beard. If this option is not available to you, grow a long braid that you can reach easily.
Although the distance is longer than with a beard, the braid structure will improve its
mnemoconductance to compensate. If you can grow neither a beard nor a braid then nose hairs
will work.

◊bf{3. Ensure an open space in front of your desk.}

Place your desk in front of a window, or anywhere that you'll have open space in front of you when
you are working. A common mistake is to place your desk in front of a wall, cubicle barrier, or
other opaque surface. This makes it difficult to think of big ideas. Big ideas need big space, so
make sure you've got it.

◊bf{4. Every 20 minutes do 10 pushups.}

Many successful researchers may not even be aware that
they are doing this.

◊bf{5. Listen to music that increases in tempo throughout the day.}

Producing research is like squeezing toothpaste from a tube. Listening to slow music is like
squeezing the tube of toothpaste near its tail. Listening to fast music is like squeezing the tube
near its opening. It is clear that one must squeeze from the tail first and then towards the
opening.

◊bf{6. Your chair must not have armrests.}

This will be clear to anyone who is familiar with the concept of 'priming' in psychology. Armrests
'prime' your mind in two ways. First, they restrict your motion, which primes you to restrict your
thoughts. Second, they prime you to think you should be resting. Neither is conducive to research.

◊bf{7. Drink coffee.}

Coffee makes you pee, even more than water. Ideas often happen in the washroom, so drinking large
amounts of coffee puts you in the right circumstances to have ideas. There may be other effects of
coffee but these are not yet known to science.

◊bf{8. Donate blood regularly.}

Getting better at research means that you get better at filtering ideas and allowing only the good
ones out. Unfortunately, that means that the bad ideas stay inside. They can build up inside your
blood and cause problems with circulation. Or, they saturate your system so that good ideas cannot
travel from the head to the hands anymore.

Donating blood helps regulate the level of bad ideas in your system. Don't worry about your bad
ideas causing problems for the recipient of your blood: ideas within the blood are "encoded", if you
will, specially for you, and they will dissipate harmlessly in another person's system. Bad ideas
are harmful to others only if they emerge in the normal way.

◊bf{9. Use the "pomodoro" technique.}

You may have already heard of the pomodoro technique: put a timer for 30 minutes and focus on work
until it rings, then take a 5 minute break and repeat. Use a timer that is either loud, bright, or
otherwise easily noticable. The effectiveness of this technique is that it reminds you of every
second you are closer to death.

◊bf{10. Your office must be on the 5th floor.}

Too low to the ground? Pollutants gather. Too high? The oxygen is lower. Either one disrupts
cognition. The optimal height is the 5th floor. Any institution that puts you on a floor other than
the 5th is not serious about research. Find another job.
